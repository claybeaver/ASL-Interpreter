# American Sign Language Interpreter

## Clay Beaver, Neil Vora, John Boer, Mark Alcocer

### Project Outline

For our project we developed a web application to predict sign language letters using a Machine Learning model.  Our model is trained to interpret the 26 letters of the sign language alphabet.  The user will use their web camera to show a hand sign, and our model will predict which letter they are presenting.
